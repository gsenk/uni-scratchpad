Yee solver for Maxwell equations in 1D with source current

Write a C-program for a 1D Maxwell solver on the FDTD grid with a source current of the form
j z (x, t) = σ E y (x, t) ,
where σ is a constant conductivity and periodic boundaries. Play with various conductivities and resolutions.
Verify your dispersion and stability results empirically.
