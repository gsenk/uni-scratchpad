# University scratchpad

In this repo I will dump a small part of the code I have produced during my years at the university.
My plan is to not change anything, but to organize the jumbled mess.

It contains technologies used in my Physics studies, but I hope you will find code snippets approachable and will get encouraged to try it yourself.

List of languages
* C
* Matlab
* Mathematica
